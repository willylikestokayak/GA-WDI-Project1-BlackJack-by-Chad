#**GA WDI Project1: BlackJack version 1 - MVP** 
First project for the GA WDI program, a working game that needs more work to be considered a true black jack game.
##**Next Steps**
	* Fix bugs; detailed below
	* Show only one of the dealer cards and display second plus dealer score after users clicks the "stand button"
	* Allow user to choose the option of making an Ace value of 1 or 11
	* Add bet function and score keeping functionality 
	* Add more styling
	* Add wire frame to readMe file
##**Bugs**
	* Deal function displays values in the text display but values remain stored as 0
	* Dealer only draws one card after the "stand button" is clicked; this functionality needs to be updated so that the dealer 	draws cards until conditional of dealer's hand is > = 17
